                            <p>Hi, my name is Ibrahim Siddiqui. I am an 18 year old student currently studying Computer Science at the University of Wollongong in Dubai. I am originally from Pakistan but I have lived most of my life in other countries notably South Africa, Qatar, Iran and the UAE. This website is a window for you to see into what my life is like, what my Hobbies and Passions are, and to see what my skills are. One of my biggest passions and my best self-taugh skill is Programming. Programming is one of the things that comes to me naturally, I use it to relax, when im stressed and when im bored. Another one of passions is Photography. My love for photography started when I had lived in South Africa, the scenery was soo beautiful there that I wanted away to capture that. I have many more hobbies and skills that I hope this webiste will convey to you.</p>
